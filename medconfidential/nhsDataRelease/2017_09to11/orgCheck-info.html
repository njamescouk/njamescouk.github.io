<td>This is an application to use SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number for the purpose of Risk Stratification. Risk Stratification provides a forecast of future demand by identifying high risk patients.  This enables commissioners to initiate proactive management plans for patients that are potentially high service users.</td>
<td>1) SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number regarding hospital admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient attendances is delivered securely from Central and Midlands Data Services for Commissioners Regional Office (DSCRO) to the data processor.<br/>
2) Data quality management and standardisation of data is completed by the DSCRO and the data identifiable at the level of NHS number is transferred securely to Midlands and Lancashire CSU (Data Processor 1), who hold the SUS data within the secure Data Centre on N3.  <br/>
3) SUS data is linked to GP data in the risk stratification tool by the data processor.<br/>
4) As part of the risk stratification processing activity, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool within the data processor, which highlights patients with whom the GP has a legitimate relationship and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems.<br/>
5) Midlands and Lancashire CSU who hosts the risk stratification system that holds SUS data is limited to those administrative staff with authorised user accounts used for identification and authentication. <br/>
6) Once Midlands and Lancashire CSU has completed the processing, the CCG can dial in to the online system via N3 connection to access the data anonymised at patient level.<br/>
</td>
<td>1) As part of the risk stratification processing activity detailed above, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool which highlights patients for whom the GP is responsible and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems. <br/>
2) Output from the risk stratification tool will provide aggregate reporting of number and percentage of population found to be at risk with no identifiers<br/>
<br/>
3) Record level output will be available for commissioners in anonymised or pseudonymised format.  <br/>
<br/>
4) GP Practices will be able to view the risk scores for individual patients with the ability to display the underlying SUS data for the individual patients when it is required for direct care purposes by someone who has a legitimate relationship with the patient. <br/>
</td>
<td>Risk stratification promotes improved case management in primary care and will lead to the following benefits being realised: <br/>
1) Improved planning by better understanding patient flows through the healthcare system, thus allowing commissioners to design appropriate pathways to improve patient flow and allowing commissioners to identify priorities and identify plans to address these.<br/>
2) Improved quality of services through reduced emergency readmissions, especially avoidable emergency admissions. This is achieved through mapping of frequent users of emergency services and early intervention of appropriate care.<br/>
3) Improved access to services by identifying which services may be in demand but have poor access, and from this identify areas where improvement is required.<br/>
4) Potentially reduced premature mortality by more targeted intervention in primary care, which supports the commissioner to meets its requirement to reduce premature mortality in line with the CCG Outcome Framework.<br/>
5) Better understanding of the health of and the variations in health outcomes within the population to help understand local population characteristics.  <br/>
All of the above lead to improved patient experience through more effective commissioning of services.<br/>

<td>This is an application to use SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number for the purpose of Risk Stratification. Risk Stratification provides a forecast of future demand by identifying high risk patients.  This enables commissioners to initiate proactive management plans for patients that are potentially high service users.</td>
<td>1) SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number regarding hospital admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient attendances is delivered securely from Central and Midlands Data Services for Commissioners Regional Office (DSCRO) to the data processor.<br/>
2) Data quality management and standardisation of data is completed by the DSCRO and the data identifiable at the level of NHS number is transferred securely to Midlands and Lancashire CSU (Data Processor 1), who hold the SUS data within the secure Data Centre on N3.  <br/>
3) SUS data is linked to GP data in the risk stratification tool by the data processor.<br/>
4) As part of the risk stratification processing activity, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool within the data processor, which highlights patients with whom the GP has a legitimate relationship and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems.<br/>
5) Midlands and Lancashire CSU who hosts the risk stratification system that holds SUS data is limited to those administrative staff with authorised user accounts used for identification and authentication. <br/>
6) Once Midlands and Lancashire CSU has completed the processing, the CCG can dial in to the online system via N3 connection to access the data anonymised at patient level.<br/>
</td>
<td>1) As part of the risk stratification processing activity detailed above, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool which highlights patients for whom the GP is responsible and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems. <br/>
2) Output from the risk stratification tool will provide aggregate reporting of number and percentage of population found to be at risk with no identifiers<br/>
<br/>
3) Record level output will be available for commissioners in anonymised or pseudonymised format.  <br/>
<br/>
4) GP Practices will be able to view the risk scores for individual patients with the ability to display the underlying SUS data for the individual patients when it is required for direct care purposes by someone who has a legitimate relationship with the patient. <br/>
</td>
<td>Risk stratification promotes improved case management in primary care and will lead to the following benefits being realised: <br/>
1) Improved planning by better understanding patient flows through the healthcare system, thus allowing commissioners to design appropriate pathways to improve patient flow and allowing commissioners to identify priorities and identify plans to address these.<br/>
2) Improved quality of services through reduced emergency readmissions, especially avoidable emergency admissions. This is achieved through mapping of frequent users of emergency services and early intervention of appropriate care.<br/>
3) Improved access to services by identifying which services may be in demand but have poor access, and from this identify areas where improvement is required.<br/>
4) Potentially reduced premature mortality by more targeted intervention in primary care, which supports the commissioner to meets its requirement to reduce premature mortality in line with the CCG Outcome Framework.<br/>
5) Better understanding of the health of and the variations in health outcomes within the population to help understand local population characteristics.  <br/>
All of the above lead to improved patient experience through more effective commissioning of services.<br/>

<td>This is an application to use SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number for the purpose of Risk Stratification. Risk Stratification provides a forecast of future demand by identifying high risk patients.  This enables commissioners to initiate proactive management plans for patients that are potentially high service users.</td>
<td>1) SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number regarding hospital admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient attendances is delivered securely from Central and Midlands Data Services for Commissioners Regional Office (DSCRO) to the data processor.<br/>
2) Data quality management and standardisation of data is completed by the DSCRO and the data identifiable at the level of NHS number is transferred securely to Midlands and Lancashire CSU (Data Processor 1), who hold the SUS data within the secure Data Centre on N3.  <br/>
3) SUS data is linked to GP data in the risk stratification tool by the data processor.<br/>
4) As part of the risk stratification processing activity, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool within the data processor, which highlights patients with whom the GP has a legitimate relationship and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems.<br/>
5) Midlands and Lancashire CSU who hosts the risk stratification system that holds SUS data is limited to those administrative staff with authorised user accounts used for identification and authentication. <br/>
6) Once Midlands and Lancashire CSU has completed the processing, the CCG can dial in to the online system via N3 connection to access the data anonymised at patient level.<br/>
</td>
<td>1) As part of the risk stratification processing activity detailed above, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool which highlights patients for whom the GP is responsible and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems. <br/>
2) Output from the risk stratification tool will provide aggregate reporting of number and percentage of population found to be at risk with no identifiers<br/>
<br/>
3) Record level output will be available for commissioners in anonymised or pseudonymised format.  <br/>
<br/>
4) GP Practices will be able to view the risk scores for individual patients with the ability to display the underlying SUS data for the individual patients when it is required for direct care purposes by someone who has a legitimate relationship with the patient. <br/>
</td>
<td>Risk stratification promotes improved case management in primary care and will lead to the following benefits being realised: <br/>
1) Improved planning by better understanding patient flows through the healthcare system, thus allowing commissioners to design appropriate pathways to improve patient flow and allowing commissioners to identify priorities and identify plans to address these.<br/>
2) Improved quality of services through reduced emergency readmissions, especially avoidable emergency admissions. This is achieved through mapping of frequent users of emergency services and early intervention of appropriate care.<br/>
3) Improved access to services by identifying which services may be in demand but have poor access, and from this identify areas where improvement is required.<br/>
4) Potentially reduced premature mortality by more targeted intervention in primary care, which supports the commissioner to meets its requirement to reduce premature mortality in line with the CCG Outcome Framework.<br/>
5) Better understanding of the health of and the variations in health outcomes within the population to help understand local population characteristics.  <br/>
All of the above lead to improved patient experience through more effective commissioning of services.<br/>

<td>This is an application to use SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number for the purpose of Risk Stratification. Risk Stratification provides a forecast of future demand by identifying high risk patients.  This enables commissioners to initiate proactive management plans for patients that are potentially high service users.</td>
<td>1) SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number regarding hospital admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient attendances is delivered securely from Central and Midlands Data Services for Commissioners Regional Office (DSCRO) to the data processor.<br/>
2) Data quality management and standardisation of data is completed by the DSCRO and the data identifiable at the level of NHS number is transferred securely to Midlands and Lancashire CSU (Data Processor 1), who hold the SUS data within the secure Data Centre on N3.  <br/>
3) SUS data is linked to GP data in the risk stratification tool by the data processor.<br/>
4) As part of the risk stratification processing activity, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool within the data processor, which highlights patients with whom the GP has a legitimate relationship and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems.<br/>
5) Midlands and Lancashire CSU who hosts the risk stratification system that holds SUS data is limited to those administrative staff with authorised user accounts used for identification and authentication. <br/>
6) Once Midlands and Lancashire CSU has completed the processing, the CCG can dial in to the online system via N3 connection to access the data anonymised at patient level.<br/>
</td>
<td>1) As part of the risk stratification processing activity detailed above, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool which highlights patients for whom the GP is responsible and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems. <br/>
2) Output from the risk stratification tool will provide aggregate reporting of number and percentage of population found to be at risk with no identifiers<br/>
<br/>
3) Record level output will be available for commissioners in anonymised or pseudonymised format.  <br/>
<br/>
4) GP Practices will be able to view the risk scores for individual patients with the ability to display the underlying SUS data for the individual patients when it is required for direct care purposes by someone who has a legitimate relationship with the patient. <br/>
</td>
<td>Risk stratification promotes improved case management in primary care and will lead to the following benefits being realised: <br/>
1) Improved planning by better understanding patient flows through the healthcare system, thus allowing commissioners to design appropriate pathways to improve patient flow and allowing commissioners to identify priorities and identify plans to address these.<br/>
2) Improved quality of services through reduced emergency readmissions, especially avoidable emergency admissions. This is achieved through mapping of frequent users of emergency services and early intervention of appropriate care.<br/>
3) Improved access to services by identifying which services may be in demand but have poor access, and from this identify areas where improvement is required.<br/>
4) Potentially reduced premature mortality by more targeted intervention in primary care, which supports the commissioner to meets its requirement to reduce premature mortality in line with the CCG Outcome Framework.<br/>
5) Better understanding of the health of and the variations in health outcomes within the population to help understand local population characteristics.  <br/>
All of the above lead to improved patient experience through more effective commissioning of services.<br/>

<td>This is an application to use SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number for the purpose of Risk Stratification. Risk Stratification provides a forecast of future demand by identifying high risk patients.  This enables commissioners to initiate proactive management plans for patients that are potentially high service users.</td>
<td>1) SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number regarding hospital admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient attendances is delivered securely from Central and Midlands Data Services for Commissioners Regional Office (DSCRO) to the data processor.<br/>
2) Data quality management and standardisation of data is completed by the DSCRO and the data identifiable at the level of NHS number is transferred securely to Midlands and Lancashire CSU (Data Processor 1), who hold the SUS data within the secure Data Centre on N3.  <br/>
3) SUS data is linked to GP data in the risk stratification tool by the data processor.<br/>
4) As part of the risk stratification processing activity, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool within the data processor, which highlights patients with whom the GP has a legitimate relationship and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems.<br/>
5) Midlands and Lancashire CSU who hosts the risk stratification system that holds SUS data is limited to those administrative staff with authorised user accounts used for identification and authentication. <br/>
6) Once Midlands and Lancashire CSU has completed the processing, the CCG can dial in to the online system via N3 connection to access the data anonymised at patient level.<br/>
</td>
<td>1) As part of the risk stratification processing activity detailed above, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool which highlights patients for whom the GP is responsible and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems. <br/>
2) Output from the risk stratification tool will provide aggregate reporting of number and percentage of population found to be at risk with no identifiers<br/>
<br/>
3) Record level output will be available for commissioners in anonymised or pseudonymised format.  <br/>
<br/>
4) GP Practices will be able to view the risk scores for individual patients with the ability to display the underlying SUS data for the individual patients when it is required for direct care purposes by someone who has a legitimate relationship with the patient. <br/>
</td>
<td>Risk stratification promotes improved case management in primary care and will lead to the following benefits being realised: <br/>
1) Improved planning by better understanding patient flows through the healthcare system, thus allowing commissioners to design appropriate pathways to improve patient flow and allowing commissioners to identify priorities and identify plans to address these.<br/>
2) Improved quality of services through reduced emergency readmissions, especially avoidable emergency admissions. This is achieved through mapping of frequent users of emergency services and early intervention of appropriate care.<br/>
3) Improved access to services by identifying which services may be in demand but have poor access, and from this identify areas where improvement is required.<br/>
4) Potentially reduced premature mortality by more targeted intervention in primary care, which supports the commissioner to meets its requirement to reduce premature mortality in line with the CCG Outcome Framework.<br/>
5) Better understanding of the health of and the variations in health outcomes within the population to help understand local population characteristics.  <br/>
All of the above lead to improved patient experience through more effective commissioning of services.<br/>

<td>This is an application to use SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number for the purpose of Risk Stratification. Risk Stratification provides a forecast of future demand by identifying high risk patients.  This enables commissioners to initiate proactive management plans for patients that are potentially high service users.</td>
<td>1) SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number regarding hospital admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient attendances is delivered securely from Central and Midlands Data Services for Commissioners Regional Office (DSCRO) to the data processor.<br/>
2) Data quality management and standardisation of data is completed by the DSCRO and the data identifiable at the level of NHS number is transferred securely to Midlands and Lancashire CSU (Data Processor 1), who hold the SUS data within the secure Data Centre on N3.  <br/>
3) SUS data is linked to GP data in the risk stratification tool by the data processor.<br/>
4) As part of the risk stratification processing activity, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool within the data processor, which highlights patients with whom the GP has a legitimate relationship and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems.<br/>
5) Midlands and Lancashire CSU who hosts the risk stratification system that holds SUS data is limited to those administrative staff with authorised user accounts used for identification and authentication. <br/>
6) Once Midlands and Lancashire CSU has completed the processing, the CCG can dial in to the online system via N3 connection to access the data anonymised at patient level.<br/>
</td>
<td>1) As part of the risk stratification processing activity detailed above, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool which highlights patients for whom the GP is responsible and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems. <br/>
2) Output from the risk stratification tool will provide aggregate reporting of number and percentage of population found to be at risk with no identifiers<br/>
<br/>
3) Record level output will be available for commissioners in anonymised or pseudonymised format.  <br/>
<br/>
4) GP Practices will be able to view the risk scores for individual patients with the ability to display the underlying SUS data for the individual patients when it is required for direct care purposes by someone who has a legitimate relationship with the patient. <br/>
</td>
<td>Risk stratification promotes improved case management in primary care and will lead to the following benefits being realised: <br/>
1) Improved planning by better understanding patient flows through the healthcare system, thus allowing commissioners to design appropriate pathways to improve patient flow and allowing commissioners to identify priorities and identify plans to address these.<br/>
2) Improved quality of services through reduced emergency readmissions, especially avoidable emergency admissions. This is achieved through mapping of frequent users of emergency services and early intervention of appropriate care.<br/>
3) Improved access to services by identifying which services may be in demand but have poor access, and from this identify areas where improvement is required.<br/>
4) Potentially reduced premature mortality by more targeted intervention in primary care, which supports the commissioner to meets its requirement to reduce premature mortality in line with the CCG Outcome Framework.<br/>
5) Better understanding of the health of and the variations in health outcomes within the population to help understand local population characteristics.  <br/>
All of the above lead to improved patient experience through more effective commissioning of services.<br/>

<td>This is an application to use SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number for the purpose of Risk Stratification. Risk Stratification provides a forecast of future demand by identifying high risk patients.  This enables commissioners to initiate proactive management plans for patients that are potentially high service users.</td>
<td>1) SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number regarding hospital admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient attendances is delivered securely from Central and Midlands Data Services for Commissioners Regional Office (DSCRO) to the data processor.<br/>
2) Data quality management and standardisation of data is completed by the DSCRO and the data identifiable at the level of NHS number is transferred securely to Midlands and Lancashire CSU (Data Processor 1), who hold the SUS data within the secure Data Centre on N3.  <br/>
3) SUS data is linked to GP data in the risk stratification tool by the data processor.<br/>
4) As part of the risk stratification processing activity, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool within the data processor, which highlights patients with whom the GP has a legitimate relationship and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems.<br/>
5) Midlands and Lancashire CSU who hosts the risk stratification system that holds SUS data is limited to those administrative staff with authorised user accounts used for identification and authentication. <br/>
6) Once Midlands and Lancashire CSU has completed the processing, the CCG can dial in to the online system via N3 connection to access the data anonymised at patient level.<br/>
</td>
<td>1) As part of the risk stratification processing activity detailed above, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool which highlights patients for whom the GP is responsible and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems. <br/>
2) Output from the risk stratification tool will provide aggregate reporting of number and percentage of population found to be at risk with no identifiers<br/>
<br/>
3) Record level output will be available for commissioners in anonymised or pseudonymised format.  <br/>
<br/>
4) GP Practices will be able to view the risk scores for individual patients with the ability to display the underlying SUS data for the individual patients when it is required for direct care purposes by someone who has a legitimate relationship with the patient. <br/>
</td>
<td>Risk stratification promotes improved case management in primary care and will lead to the following benefits being realised: <br/>
1) Improved planning by better understanding patient flows through the healthcare system, thus allowing commissioners to design appropriate pathways to improve patient flow and allowing commissioners to identify priorities and identify plans to address these.<br/>
2) Improved quality of services through reduced emergency readmissions, especially avoidable emergency admissions. This is achieved through mapping of frequent users of emergency services and early intervention of appropriate care.<br/>
3) Improved access to services by identifying which services may be in demand but have poor access, and from this identify areas where improvement is required.<br/>
4) Potentially reduced premature mortality by more targeted intervention in primary care, which supports the commissioner to meets its requirement to reduce premature mortality in line with the CCG Outcome Framework.<br/>
5) Better understanding of the health of and the variations in health outcomes within the population to help understand local population characteristics.  <br/>
All of the above lead to improved patient experience through more effective commissioning of services.<br/>

<td>This is an application to use SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number for the purpose of Risk Stratification. Risk Stratification provides a forecast of future demand by identifying high risk patients.  This enables commissioners to initiate proactive management plans for patients that are potentially high service users.</td>
<td>1) SUS data identifiable at the level of NHS number regarding hospital admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient attendances is delivered securely from Central and Midlands Data Services for Commissioners Regional Office (DSCRO) to the data processor.<br/>
2) Data quality management and standardisation of data is completed by the DSCRO and the data identifiable at the level of NHS number is transferred securely to Midlands and Lancashire CSU (Data Processor 1), who hold the SUS data within the secure Data Centre on N3.  <br/>
3) SUS data is linked to GP data in the risk stratification tool by the data processor.<br/>
4) As part of the risk stratification processing activity, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool within the data processor, which highlights patients with whom the GP has a legitimate relationship and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems.<br/>
5) Midlands and Lancashire CSU who hosts the risk stratification system that holds SUS data is limited to those administrative staff with authorised user accounts used for identification and authentication. <br/>
6) Once Midlands and Lancashire CSU has completed the processing, the CCG can dial in to the online system via N3 connection to access the data anonymised at patient level.<br/>
</td>
<td>1) As part of the risk stratification processing activity detailed above, GPs have access to the risk stratification tool which highlights patients for whom the GP is responsible and have been classed as at risk. The only identifier available to GPs is the NHS numbers of their own patients. Any further identification of the patients will be completed by the GP on their own systems. <br/>
2) Output from the risk stratification tool will provide aggregate reporting of number and percentage of population found to be at risk with no identifiers<br/>
<br/>
3) Record level output will be available for commissioners in anonymised or pseudonymised format.  <br/>
<br/>
4) GP Practices will be able to view the risk scores for individual patients with the ability to display the underlying SUS data for the individual patients when it is required for direct care purposes by someone who has a legitimate relationship with the patient. <br/>
</td>
<td>Risk stratification promotes improved case management in primary care and will lead to the following benefits being realised: <br/>
1) Improved planning by better understanding patient flows through the healthcare system, thus allowing commissioners to design appropriate pathways to improve patient flow and allowing commissioners to identify priorities and identify plans to address these.<br/>
2) Improved quality of services through reduced emergency readmissions, especially avoidable emergency admissions. This is achieved through mapping of frequent users of emergency services and early intervention of appropriate care.<br/>
3) Improved access to services by identifying which services may be in demand but have poor access, and from this identify areas where improvement is required.<br/>
4) Potentially reduced premature mortality by more targeted intervention in primary care, which supports the commissioner to meets its requirement to reduce premature mortality in line with the CCG Outcome Framework.<br/>
5) Better understanding of the health of and the variations in health outcomes within the population to help understand local population characteristics.  <br/>
All of the above lead to improved patient experience through more effective commissioning of services.<br/>
