<td>The study will test the hypothesis that there is a time-dependent increase in CRC incidence following BS in England & Wales (E&W). Similar database-linkage methodology will be used to that employed in a previous population-based Swedish study (10), namely calculation of the SIR for CRC of BS patients and an obese no surgery cohort. This will enable comparison of the results of this study with the Swedish data (10). Importantly, the design of the current proposal will provide significant advantages over the Swedish study as: 1.the number of BS patients and CRC cases will be larger, thus increasing study power 2.linkage to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) will provide the opportunity to observe changes in BMI after BS that was not possible in the Swedish Registry study<br/>
3.linkage to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) will provide the opportunity to perform a preliminary investigation of whether colorectal adenoma risk increases after BS The study will also test the secondary hypothesis, therefore, that colorectal adenoma incidence increases with time after BS.</td>

<td>The Million Women Study is a national cohort study of UK women. In 1996-2001, 1.3 million women, aged 50-64, who had been invited for breast cancer screening at centres throughout England and Scotland, were recruited into the study. All women completed a recruitment questionnaire on hormonal, anthropometric, and other personal characteristics and attended at least one routine mammographic screen which took place at recruitment into the study. The cohort has been re-surveyed at approximately 3 yearly intervals since recruitment to update information on various factors (see http://www.millionwomenstudy.org.uk for further details of the study and questionnaires). <br/>
<br/>
All participants have been flagged on the NHS central registers for incident cancer, yielding data on cancer site (coded according to ICD-10) and morphology (coded according to ICD-O). Although it has been shown that cancer diagnosis can be adequately determined from the information routinely collected in NHS central registers, linkage with the cancer registry data would afford the important benefit of a more tumour specific data on each incident case. Through data linkage to cancer registration data, the study aims to describe the relationship between reproductive, hormonal, genetic and lifestyle factors and the risk of cancers at specific sites according to key tumour characteristics. This research should not only provide information on which risk factors are associated with specific cancer subtypes but may also clarify some of the biological mechanisms underlying these associations.</td>

<td>Since recruitment began in 2006, the study has created a major resource of person-level data for 500,000 adults, including annotated blood and urine samples, alongside self-reported lifestyle and behavioural information. With the consent of each participant, these baseline data are being linked to their health-related records, (in such a way that the participant?s confidentiality is preserved) so that the baseline information can be used in conjunction with the information about health conditions that develop. Tumour-level information held by the cancer registry has already strengthened UK Biobank and will enable a diverse range of research into improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. UK Biobank request to extend this dataset to include receptor status (i.e. ER, PR and HER2 status) for all invasive and DCIS breast tumours to allow for stratification of these tumours by receptor-defined subtypes.  This will allow UK Biobank applicants to evaluate the variations in the risks of breast cancer across each receptor subtype by demographic or clinical characteristics, and to extend knowledge regarding the prognostic utility of receptor subtypes. In addition a description of the coding used for tumours site will be included.</td>

<td>Linkage to the national screening programme will also give us access to the frequency of breast cancer screening attendance. The UK breast screening programme has recently expanded to include women aged 47- 73 on a three yearly basis. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK and although this is associated with an 85% 5 year survival rate there were still 11,500 attributable deaths in 2012. Past research has suggested that patients with RA may have lesser occurrence of breast cancer compared to those without RA.<br/>
Our own analysis of the BSRBR-RA dataset has also identified a trend towards lesser breast cancer in patients receiving TNF inhibitors which suggests that this association may relate to inflammation or another related factor. This linkage will allow us to look at whether the frequency of breast screening attendance is altered in this population.</td>

<td>Using data from the General Practice Research Database with linkage to data on hospital admissions, cancer registrations and death registration (including cause of death), we will carry out the following:<br/>
i) Calculate hazard ratios of VTE compared with controls both for overall cancer and individually for the most common cancers in the UK. <br/>
Ii) Determine the incidence of VTE among cancer patients during episodes of inpatient hospitalisation, and whether and by how much surgery additionally increases the within-hospital risk.<br/>
Iii) Compare the incidence of VTE during different ambulatory periods among cancer patients. We will create successive exposure intervals (for example of 7-14 days duration) post hospital discharge (both for inpatient and day case admissions) and following outpatient chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other ambulatory cancer treatments to identify periods of highest risk and when the risk returns to baseline.<br/>
Iv) Establish how the incidence of VTE in high risk periods (especially ambulatory) is influenced by between patient covariates (e.g. age, sex, cancer type, cancer stage and comorbidity).<br/>
V) Determine the incidence of VTE on the basis of time since initial cancer diagnosis (both absolute risk and risk compared with controls) in order to assess the length of time following a cancer diagnosis an increased risk of VTE persists.</td>

<td>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the commonest cancer in men in the United Kingdom (UK) and the number of men with this disease is increasing. Its treatment may impact physically, psychologically and socially, affecting the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of men and their partners/spouses. In addition to improving treatments it is important to measure outcomes of importance to patients, partners/spouses so that services can be tailored to meet men?s needs. Using a series of linked projects our main AIMS are: <br/>
?To describe the HRQL (e.g., physical, psychosocial) of men with prostate cancer using qualitative and quantitative methods; <br/>
?To explore if and how their HRQL is associated (cross-sectional) or is predicted by (longitudinal) disease, treatment and/or patient characteristics with a view to  inform development of health care policy and service delivery in ways that better meet the needs of such men and their families;<br/>
?To describe the levels of patient empowerment and undertake preliminary exploration of the interaction between patient empowerment and HRQL.</td>
